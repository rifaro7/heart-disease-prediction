# 🏩Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

# 👨‍🏫Project Overview:

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
It uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset and applies a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.

# 🎯The goal is to:

Explore and preprocess the dataset.
Train a machine learning model.
Evaluate its performance on training and testing sets.
Build a simple predictive system.

# Dataset:

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data

# Target variable:

0 → No Heart Disease

1 → Heart Disease Present

# 👩🏻‍💻Technologies Used:

Python,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn.

# 🚀How to Run:

git clone[ https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
](https://github.com/rifaro7/heart-disease-prediction.git)

# 📈Project Workflow:

Import Libraries – NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

Load Dataset – Heart Disease CSV file.

Data Exploration – shape, missing values, value counts.

Preprocessing – split features (X) and target (Y).

Train-Test Split – 80% training, 20% testing.

Model Training – Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation – accuracy on train and test sets.

Predictive System – test with new patient data.



# Future Improvements:

Try other models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
Compare performance of multiple algorithms.
Add data visualization (heatmaps, histograms).
Deploy as a web app (using Flask/Streamlit).
